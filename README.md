# Mvstate React Examples
Mvstate started with React in mind. These examples show how nicely React and Mvstate
play together. See src/examples for examples. Feel free to add your own through a PR.
This whole project is a create-react-app project. Clone the project, do a "npm i"
followed by "npm start" and you should have it up and running.

I'd recommend having a look at Counter first. This is kind of the Hello World of Mvstate.
TicTacToe is a more advanced example to show you a clear separation of view and
"business" logic. Checkout is an example of a multi-step form.

When looking at the examples, pay attention to what kind of code you find in the
component versus in the model.

Cheers,
