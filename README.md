# Mvsplit React Examples
Mvsplit started with React in mind. These examples show how nicely React and Mvsplit
play together. See src/examples for examples. Feel free to add your own through a PR.
This whole project is a create-react-app project. Clone the project, do a "npm i"
followed by "npm start" and you should have it up and running.

I'd recommend having a look at Counter first. This is kind of the Hello World of mvsplit.
TicTacToe is a more advanced example to show you a clear separation of view and
"business" logic.

Next example will most likely be how to share models between multiple complex
components, and when to introduce new models in a component hierarchy.

Cheers,
